        My name is Evan Parker, and I like to design and build all kinds of
        things. I use my skills to design, build, launch, and maintain apps and
        websites from scratch, using multiples languages, libraries and
        frameworks. I am a native Londoner, born and raised in this crazy,
        wonderful city.
        <br />
        <br /> I am passionate about city life, travelling, art, culture,
        technology and and all things digital. I am a wearer of many hats, and
        my experience also includes scriptwriting, blogging, journalism, project
        management in the arts and public sector. I have a passion for making
        beautiful interfaces with excellent usability. I always seek to learn
        new things and experiences.
